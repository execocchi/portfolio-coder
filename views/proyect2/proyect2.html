            Clarín is an Argentinian morning newspaper published in the city of
            Buenos Aires which was founded on 28 August, 1945. It’s a digital
            version, Clarin.com, is the third most followed spanish digital
            newspaper in the world with 8.179.000 of unique users.

            <h4 class="title">The Solution</h4>
            <p>
            Following the world’s main news media international trends, such as
            New York Times or The Guardian, Clarín has created a paywall to five
            access to it’s digital product despite the fact the daily consumption
            is in decline.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grey-background">
            <h4 class="title">Challenge</h4>
            <p>
            We need to persuade the users so as to convince them that this was
            necessary to pay for something that until then had been free online.
            The printed newspaper had to be paid but not the digital version.

            <h4 class="title">Research</h4>
            <h4>We need to understand our users and what they are expecting</h4>
            <p>
            As the newspaper already has a lot of unique users, we wanted to
            understand what they valued the most and why they have chosen it to
            inform themselves each day.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h4>User Testing</h4>
            <p>
            We tested the product with 10 users, 5 heavy users (those who express
            total loyalty to the newspaper) and 5 swallows (those who read a bit
            of different types of news media without expressing loyalty)
            </p>
            <p>
            We decided to test in these two groups to understand what made them
            choose this newspaper and also what they valued, if someone is
            expressing total loyalty we don’t want to lose them, but at the same
            time, we want the users that compare different media and see what
            their expectations are.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h4>Focus Groups</h4>
            <p>
            We had 3 focus groups, two with heavy users and one mixed, between
            heavy and swallows. We didn’t tell the users we were working with
            Clarin, the main idea of these was to take real insights from users,
            and work on a safe environment. We used several moderating techniques,
            like a ball that they could be passing to each other so everyone got
            it’s chance to speak. In these focus groups is really normal for the
            users to want to share their personal opinion so it’s important to not
            lose the focus and keep it neutral.

        <div class="text">
            <h4>How to use the insights</h4>
            <p>
            After we gathered all the insights and understood the reasons why
            users where choosing Clarín we decided to reinforce all the positive
            aspects, and try to improve the things that were confusing for the
            users. We wanted them to have a experience inside the newspaper, both
            in mobile and desktop. Regarding the paywall, what we needed to do was
            to show the users the value of the product and by this convince them
            that what they will be paying for was good and they will be happy with
            it. We also propose, as an improvement, giving more benefits to the
            payed users, such as discounts on other products or extra
            functionalities such as personal recommendations.
